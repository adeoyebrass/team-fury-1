## <a name="getstarted"></a> Getting Started - Script Task for Stage 2

### <a name="install"></a> Installation
To get started locally, follow these instructions:

1. Unless you've already done so, you will first need to [make a fork of this repo](https://www.github.com/jgodstime/team-fury-1/fork).
2. Use your forked repo to clone to your local repository by using `git`.
3. Make sure that you have XAMPP 7.x.x or later installed (remember your install path for later). See instructions [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

## <a name="createscript"></a> Creating Your Script
The stage 2 task requres each and every member in Team Fury to create a script. Read further for more information.

### The Goal
The goal of the stage 2 task is to create a script file that outputs a string in the following format:

`Hello World, this is <Your Full Name> with HNGi7 ID <Your HNG ID> and email <Your Email> using <Your Programming Language> for stage 2 task`.

### Things To Consider
1. Your script file should be located in the scripts folder.
2. Your script file should be named using this convention: `<your-username>.(js or php or py)`.
2. The 4 required data fields should be variables.
3. Your programming language should either be: PHP, Python, or JavaScript.

## <a name="runserver"></a> Running a Local Test Server
To run the local test server, follow these instructions:

1. Move your local repo to your XAMPP htdocs folder `path/to/your/xampp/htdocs`.
2. Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
3. Start the Apache module.
4. In the URL bar of your preferred browser, go to `localhost/<local-repo-folder-name>/index.php`. The `<local-repo-folder-name>` is the folder name of the local repo you moved in step 1 above.
